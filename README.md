# ChiCaP
Pipeline takes bam files from matched germline and somatic cancer patient samples, performs annotation, filtering and merging. 
Further, it flags variants within the merged vcf file into "Germline" or "Somatic". 
The program will be used to improve analysis of germline variants leading to Childhood Cancer Predisposition (ChiCaP), by including information from somatic tumor analyses.
